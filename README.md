## Project Description

Travel Time is a travel tracker where users can plan for future trips. Users can enter a trip with their budget and dates and add potential options of flights and hotels to choose the best option for them. Users can store data from a variety of airlines and hotel brands to see everthing in one place.

This app will include a backend database using Django and SQL and a frontend web application using Node.js and React.

## User Stories

The user of this app loves to travel and is looking for a way to store flight and hotel ideas and compare for the best options. They are always browsing multiple sites but lose their place and want to hold it all in one location. This user is also concerned with budget and would like to compare different options to see what the most fiscally responsible idea is.
